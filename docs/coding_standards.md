**Key Coding & Documentation Standards** 
*Arduino Code*
- Comment every variable or constant declaration with a description of what the variable does.
- Comment every code block. Do it before the block if possible, so the reader knows what's coming
- Comment every for loop
- Main file includes title block, example:
    > /*
    > Sketch title
    > 
    > Describe what it does in layman's terms.  Refer to the components
    > attached to the various pins.
    > 
    > The circuit:
    > * list the components attached to each input
    > * list the components attached to each output
    > 
    > Created [day month year]
    > By [author's name]
    > Modified [day month year]
    > By [author's name]
